### [Out of the tar pit](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) / 2006

Complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful develop-
ment of large-scale software systems. Following Brooks we distinguish
accidental from essential difficulty, but disagree with his premise that
most complexity remaining in contemporary systems is essential. We
identify common causes of complexity and discuss general approaches
which can be taken to eliminate them where they are accidental in
nature. To make things more concrete we then give an outline for
a potential complexity-minimizing approach based on functional pro-
gramming and Coddâ€™s relational model of data.
